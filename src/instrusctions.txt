Model directory :
Contains the convolutional neural network model

Rotation directory :
Purpose of this directory is to prepare training dataset

test_dataset directory :
Contains test image

train dataset:
Contains training dataset I have used
    i.e: Image name : pic00001_270 include original image name and the rotated angle (both separated by '_')

mlb.pickle : serialized labeling

sertis_model_e100_b20.model : serialized model on epochs 100 and batch size 20

train.py : class for train the dataset (simply python train.py would do the work)

classify.py : class for classification (simply python classify.py would do the work)
